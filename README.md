Export-privatepics
==================

Export images from privatepics app iTunes backup.


Why
==================
I lost my images saved in the app privatepics (com.dreamingphone.privatepics) after installing an iOS beta.

Using iPhone backup extractor (http://supercrazyawesome.com/) i exported the PPStorage.private.
Turns out that it's just a SQLite Db, so I wrote this small script to export the images.

Leaving it here if someone else needs it :)
